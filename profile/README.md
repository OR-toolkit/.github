# Operations Research Suite

This organization hosts a collection of projects related to mathematical optimization, stochastic modeling, and algorithmic research.  
The goal is to develop clear, reproducible, and practically useful tools that explore different aspects of operations research and data-driven decision systems.

## Current Projects
- **Column Generation Solver** – A modular implementation for large-scale optimization using decomposition methods.  
- **Two-Stage Stochastic Programming** – Experiments and tools for modeling uncertainty in linear systems.

## Participation
Contributions, discussions, and extensions are welcome.  
The repositories are intended for open exploration of optimization methods, from theory to computational experiments.
